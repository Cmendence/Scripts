This Script for RaiGames and Ethcrash feature a user interface that displays certain statistics, this interface will be under constant improvement so be sure to check for new features.  

# How the script works
Whereas alot of scripts have a base bet that you set, mine do not have that you enter the total amount of bits you want the script to use instead and then the script will automatically compute what the base bet should be.

# 4x Script
The way the 4x Script functions is that on a loss it will multiply the base bet by 4 and then will compute what it needs to set the crash at to break even.  Therefore this script will only bring you profit on winning the first bet, and will only attempt to break even on the subsequent bets on a loss streak. However you can still gain a small profit in loss streaks via bonuses.

# 1.25x Script
This script is very similar to the 4x script however it will multiply the bet by 4x on the first loss and then by 5x on every subsiqent loss. It will also stay at 1.25x for every loss.
